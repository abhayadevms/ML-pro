# ML-pro

# step: 1
Data Collection :
Scope my project gather the required data and engineer feature for the task

# step2:
Training model :
Modeifying the data and improve the result

# step: 3
Deployement in Production :
Tracking data that moght lead performance loss (drift etc) and 'triggering re-training'

# Model- centric
Hold the data fixed and iteratively improve the code/model

# Data centric
Hold the model fixed and itervely improve the data

what is the business problem we are trying to solve
1) cost of wrong prediction

# break Down the Sale Forecating Process

we decompose the sales forecating process into its component tasks
such as :
1) data gathering
2) historical sales analysis
3) marked trend analysis
# estimate ROI
# Value propostion :
1) who need the our product
2) product and service
3) product category & benfit

# Data sources:
1) cost of data storage
2) purchasing  external data

# prediction Task
Decide the ML

# Featuring Engineering
working with domain experts to extract features from raw data source

# Offline Evaluation 
before deployment : setting up metrics to evaluate system performance

# Data Engineer
## Data ingestion :
Collection of data from diffrence source

## Exploration and Validation 
Understanding data content and struture

## Data Wrangling:
Formatting and Cleaning the data

## Data labeling: 
Assiging categrories to data points

## Data Spliting:
Division of data into training, validation and test datasets
